      <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials for HTML and CSS">

      Define the author of a page:
      <meta name="author" content="John Doe">

      Refresh document every 30 seconds:
      <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

      Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      ```  
2. Put a meta tag for each of these uses into your Fish Creek Web Pages. 
      ```html
      <meta name="keywords" content="Animal, Hospital, Veterinarians, Vets, Fish Creek">
      <meta name="description" content="Fish Creek Animal Hospital”">
      <meta name="author" content="Magda Patel ">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      ```  
3. Copy the head section/make a screenshot of one of the web pages with the meta tag and paste into your blog.  
      ```html
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Fish Creek Animal Hospital</title>
        <meta name="keywords" content="Animal, Hospital, Veterinarians, Vets, Fish Creek">
        <meta name="description" content="Fish Creek Animal Hospital”">
